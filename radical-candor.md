# Radical Candor

[source](https://www.radicalcandor.com/our-approach/)

Radical Candor is Caring Personally while Challenging Directly. At its core it is guidance and feedback that is both kind and clear whilst specific and sincere.

What it is not...

## Obnoxious Aggression

This is 'brutal honesty' - challenging but not caring

## Ruinous Empathy

This is what happens when you want to spare someone’s short-term feelings, so you don’t tell them something they need to know. You Care Personally, but fail to Challenge Directly.

## Manipulative Insincerity

This is backstabbing, political or passive-aggressive behaviour. It is what happens when you neither Care Personally nor Challenge Directly and being 'Two faced'. Should you be a leader if you genuinely feel like this?
