The goal with embracing Agile practices should always to put the users/customers at the forefront of the decision-making process, to inspect and adapt to quickly learn what is working and what isn’t, and to deliver useable things as quickly as possible to those users to get their feedback. To deliver this well, you need a high functioning, trusting team, and this typically requires some structural changes to enable teams to be set up like this from the beginning. That can take some time or multiple iterations before organizations are able to do their best agile work.
