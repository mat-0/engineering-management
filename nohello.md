2010-07-19 12:32:12 you: Hi
2010-07-19 12:32:15 co-worker: Hello.
# CO-WORKER WAITS WHILE YOU PHRASE YOUR QUESTION
2010-07-19 12:34:01 you: I'm working on [something] and I'm trying to do [etc...]
2010-07-19 12:35:21 co-worker: Oh, that's [answer...]
```

It's as if you called someone on the phone and said "Hi!" and then put them on hold!

Please do this instead:

```
2010-07-19 12:32:12 you: Hi -- I'm working on [something] and I'm trying to do [etc...]
2010-07-19 12:33:32 co-worker: [answers question]
```

Note that you get help minutes sooner, and you don't make them wait. Instead, the co-worker can start thinking about your question right away!
