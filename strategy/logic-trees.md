# Logic Trees

Every strategy starts with a set of problems to be solved. The strategy is a set of solutions to those problems. The logic tree branches out as a decomposition of a problem.

The output of a logic tree is a diagram, use techniques like the five whys and for each answer create a [MECE](/mece.md)  list.

A hypothesis is a starting point for an investigation. When one hypothesize, one makes a claim about why something might be the case, based on limited data. i.e. to offer up an explanation or a path forward. This puts a stake in the ground, a marker, for future work.

Start by asking the following five questions:

1. What is the conjunct of propositions that describe the problem?
2. what semantics characterize these propositions?
3. what are the possible outcomes?
4. what are the probabilities of each of these outcomes coming true?
5. what ease and impact scoring values suggest the right strategy?

## What is the conjunct of propositions that describe the problem

When it is time to perform analysis, define the problem as a set of propositions, each proposition is connected by the conjunct, the logical operator AND).

## what semantics characterize these propositions

Now you create an interpretation of each proposition based on the discourse. This falls in to a matter of language e.g. play means something to a child than it does a theatre goer. Define common understand, challenge what language might be unclear, ask how biases might be entering your work. keep a glossary of terms if necessary. Keep language clear, precise and accurate.

## what are the possible outcomes

Determining the possible outcomes of a decision or action is an act of imagination and reasoning. Write down possible outcomes as a MECE list. Watch out for inductive reasoning - find facts. Start by defining your terms ans looking at data you have.

## what are the probabilities of each of these outcomes coming true

There is no need to be super-specific, using language like 45.58% will give a false sense of precision and therefore expectation. Something like the moving sales online could increase revenues between 40-60%.

Don't make assumptions too quickly. unfamiliar doesn't mean improbable.

## what ease and impact scoring values suggest the right strategy

Assigning outcomes with values in order to prioritise them. using a 2-by-2 grid of `Ease of execution` vs `impact` and score then plot your outcomes accordingly.

- Top right items are relatively easy to do and have greatest effect. They should be prioritised first
- Bottom left items are the things that will be hard to do and make only a small advance. They should be prioritised last
- Top left items are things that are easiest to do but have relatively small impact they should be prioritised second
- Bottom right items are things that are hard or time consuming but are important to advancing they should be prioritised in the third group.

We can then use the Pareto principle and differentiate signal and noise. Nate Silver wrote a book about this and suggested in a game of poker you can make the same decisions as a pro 80% of the time by learning the hands, learn the rough idea of the odds, fold your worst hands and make a modest effort to consider your opponents cards and this can be done in 20% of the time.

This might also be covered by the notion that perfect is the enemy of good - and good enough will probably do.
