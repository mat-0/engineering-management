# The five-minute coach framework

## The principles

1. Stick with the process
2. The coachee has all the answers
3. Ownership is with the coachee
4. You drive the coaching
5. You create and manage the setting.

## Set the scene

Where would you like to sit (gesturing around the space)?

And where would you like me to sit?

Let me explain a little about this coaching. My Job is to help you to explore your issue, work out what you want and how you are going to achieve it. I won't be offering you idea or suggestions as to how to do it.

You'll soon find that this isn't like a normal conversation or even any coaching session you may have had before. I won't look at you much, and I won't make any suggestions or comments about what you say

I will be taking notes to help me remember what you've said. And at the end, I'll give you all the notes.

Anything you say is confidential, unless it is illegal, or unsafe.

If I ask you any questions that seem unusual or odd, just answer with the first thing that comes to mind.

Once we start, I won't answer any questions as that will interrupt the flow. So… Is there anything you'd like to ask me now?

**Remember** :

1. Play close attention
2. Use only the five-minute coach questions
3. Avoid the normal rules of conversation
4. Repeat the coachee's words
5. Disregard grammatical rules
6. Take notes
7. Limit eye contact
8. Encourage the coachee
9. Use voice to influence
10. Stay cool, calm and collected.
