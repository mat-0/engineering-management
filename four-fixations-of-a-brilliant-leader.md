# Four Fixations of a Brilliant Leader

Is based on the VIDA way of leadership.

## Vision

The objective of a vision is to create a highly desirable future state, one which attracts people to be a part of the endeavour to make it real, and which creates engagement and alignment around the common goal.

The three key behaviours underpin the creation of an inspiring leadership vision.

### The first is gathering information using the seven questions

- Who are the current stakeholders?
- What are the main external trends?
- What are the critical factors in our systems and processes?
- What aspects of the team empower people the most?
- What aspects disempower people?
- What do we know?
- What don't we know?

### The second behaviour is creating a vision is called concept formation

This about linking ideas and bringing key ideas from different places. Techniques include Spider's web or Pizza Pie Chart.

The pizza pie chart is a circle, like a clock face split into 12 segments and with 5 concentric circles. The idea is to cluster the outcomes of the first questions above in to logical groups - things that seem to go together, starting on the outside. Once this is complete one then moves the things that are most important i.e. more central to the vision, inwards towards the centre. Clearly formed ideas become visible.

### The Third vital thinking behaviour is flexible thinking

This is rare, but people who di it have trained themselves to become very good at forming a second choice, an alternative vision, solution, or course of action that is every bit as good as the first one. Finding the second right answer.

## Inspiration

The ability to get your message across both clearly and concisely. What one says needs to be well-structured. Whether it is to an audience, a board meeting, or an individual,one needs to have the basics in place - good eye contract and minimal distractions, it is vital that one communicates one's key ideas with economy and clarity

## Development

As soon as one starts to put more fluid and responsive structures in place, one generates a need for people to become more flexible and more creative, in terms of thinking about what they are doing and how do it better. That generates a need for systems thinking and collaborative behaviours.

This is split in to 3 sections.

- Investment in teamwork - equalising airtime of different group members, facilitating dialogue between them to enable sight of connections and similarities of their ideas.
- Building a climate of trust, understanding, and openness. One in which people are valued for saying what they really think without the fear of criticism, judgement, nor punishment.
- Developing capabilities of people -  The role of the leader is to build that environment and to create way for others to coach, mentor, train, and provide recognition and vie constructive performance feedback.

## Action

Action is probably the area in which leaders or would-be leaders need the least personal help or development. This is about ensuring one takes the right action. The key point is the extend to which one can reduce the constraints on people to enhance their freedom to act and broaden their scope to use initiative.
